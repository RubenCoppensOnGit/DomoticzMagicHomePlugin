# DomoticzMagicHomePlugin
initial version : V1 (reused FluxLed library)
find ALL magic-home devices on the network
all magic home devices are added in Domoticz and for each of them 3 switches are created
color switch (incl on/of + brightness), mode switch, speed switch
only the on of switch is functional. The rest requires implementation.

in future : the switches need to become sub devices.. Images need to be adopted
switches types need to be adopted, input switches need to be created for scene
level switches need to be implemented for brightness and speed
switch for color need to be implemented
